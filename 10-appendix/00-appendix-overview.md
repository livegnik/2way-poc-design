# 00 Appendix overview

The appendix collects non-normative reference material and navigational aids. It does not override the normative specifications in `specs/`. If any appendix content conflicts with a spec, the spec is authoritative.

## Contents

- `01-glossary.md`: quick index of canonical terms (full definitions live in `specs/00-scope/03-definitions-and-terminology.md`).
- `02-reference-config.md`: configuration namespace index and pointers to authoritative config specs.
- `03-open-questions.md`: tracked open questions or deferred items that need ADRs or spec updates.
- `diagrams/`: illustrative diagrams that support the specs.
- `meta/`: meta specifications used to keep the normative specs consistent.

Use this folder for reference material and cross-links, not for new normative requirements.
